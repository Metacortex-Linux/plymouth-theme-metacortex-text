Description: graphical boot animation and logger - metacortex-text theme
 Plymouth is an application that runs very early in the boot process
 (even before the root filesystem is mounted!) that provides a graphical
 boot animation while the boot process happens in the background.
 .
 This package contains the default metacortex-text theme used when no support for
 a graphical theme is found on your system.
